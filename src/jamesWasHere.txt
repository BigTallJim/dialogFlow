xxxxxxxxxxxxxCSS-60967900T0N000045uQubI ordered a Click and Collect but put the wrong date for collection. I couldn't find how to change it on the website so rang instead. The person I spoke to on the 'phone was extremely helpful.
CASE-13510738CSS-609681xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxGood day,I ordered and paid for 2 large Camden Couches on the 28 September 2019 57242781. They told me they would be delivered in 8 - 10 weeks. Before Christmas. I emailed the help line at 14 weeks, and went into the Oxford Street store the next day. First, they could not find my order at all. When they eventually did, it was cancelled some time in October. This could not be true as no one had attempted to return my money, and if they had I would have objected to the cancellation. They have now made a new order 58015767 and say the delivery is now 16 weeks!! I have an empty lounge and may have to live with until May - 8 months! This is unacceptable. Please could you look into my case, and keep me updated.Regards,Janet SchulzCase number 13510738
xxxxxxxxxxxxxCSS-60968200T0N000045xf0dI think, as it was New Year's Eve the phones were very busy and it took nearly an hour before my call was answered.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxCSS-60968300T0N000045xgwfI appreciate it was New Year's Eve afternoon, however I waited over 20 minutes - twice - (as I was cut off the first time) for my call to be answered. Once I was put through, a wonderful lady in York Vanguard branch resolved my query. Wait-time was unacceptable, but actually speaking to a customer service agent was excellent and all staff went the extra mile for me. Thankyou.
CASE-13480476CSS-609684xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxVery unhelpful, not understanding, difficult and obstructive person, KARA (who took call). The whole experience was awful. I usually shop from John Lewis but this time right from placing an order to having his call from John Lewis was extremely poor.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxCSS-60968500T0N000045xOhIAges waiting on phone,tried over two days.Finally polite,friendly response.would appreciate better email use from dispatch team in order to ensure presence on arrival of goods.
CASE-13415000CSS-609687xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI ordered and paid for an item well in advance of christmas It seems to have been lost and a refund is all I have to show .
CASE-13524720CSS-609688xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI wanted to purchase a JL product which had mixed reviews and was trying to get any information that might explain the differences. The item concerned was to be a replacement for an old JL product which has given excellent service.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxCSS-60972000T0N000042z7eqJohn Lewis refuses to provide refund and any help. This is the most disgusting treatment I have ever had in my life as a consumer. I will certainly seek legal action next week and submit my records of this transaction to Trading Standards. I will certainly encourage everybody to avoid the brand. I am very disappointed that a brand that I once held in the highest regard has now become the most incompetent and dishonest brands I have ever come across in my life.
